# Update 12.5.2017 - The Firefox extension has been merged with the [Chrome extension. Go there instead](https://github.com/coreytegeler/add-art-chrome/) *****


## Add-Art
Add-Art is a Firefox ([Chrome](https://github.com/coreytegeler/add-art-chrome) & [Safari](https://github.com/owise1/add-art-safari)) Browser Extension that replaces ads with art.

When it works, it works pretty good. We all want it to be better, and we welcome your help with that.

### Development 

#### To install:

First you'll need to [install jpm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#Installation). Then install the npm packages:

```
npm install
```

#### To work on the popup:

```
npm run watch
```
Then open `data/popup.html` in a browser

#### To run extension in the browser:

First you need to download the [nightly build](https://nightly.mozilla.org/). Then... 

```
npm run jpm 
```

#### How it currently works

Add-Art v2 no longer depends on Ad Block Plus and makes use of the [Mozilla Addons SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK). An "essay" (or exhibition) within add-art is simply a JSON file. [This repo](https://github.com/owise1/addendum-exhibitions) lays out an essay's JSON schema.  

Kadist's [Addendum](http://addendum.kadist.org/) visual essays ship with the extension. The configuration for those essays are kept [here](https://github.com/owise1/addendum-exhibitions). 

Users can also create their own essays on the [add-art site](http://add-art.org/essays/).  They receive a link to the JSON for the essay and can use it to import the show into their extension.
